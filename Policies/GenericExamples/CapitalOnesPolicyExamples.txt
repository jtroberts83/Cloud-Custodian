    There's a number of caveats to usage. Resources which don't
    include tagging as part of their api may have some delay before
    automation kicks in to create a tag. Real world delay may be several
    minutes, with worst case into hours[0]. This creates a race condition
    between auto tagging and automation.

    In practice this window is on the order of a fraction of a second, as
    we fetch the resource and evaluate the presence of the tag before
    attempting to tag it.

Resource Scheduling Offhours
============================

Custodian provides for time based filters, that allow for taking periodic
action on a resource, with resource schedule customization based on tag values.
A common use is offhours scheduling for asgs and instances.

Features
========

- Flexible offhours scheduling with opt-in, opt-out selection, and timezone
  support.
- Resume during offhours support.
- Can be combined with other filters to get a particular set (
  resources with tag, vpc, etc).
- Can be combined with arbitrary actions

Policy Configuration
====================

We provide an `onhour` and `offhour` time filter, each should be used in a
different policy, they support the same configuration options:

 - **weekends**: default true, whether to leave resources off for the weekend
 - **weekend-only**: default false, whether to turn the resource off only on
   the weekend
 - **default_tz**: which timezone to utilize when evaluating time **(REQUIRED)**
 - **tag**: which resource tag name to use for per-resource configuration
   (schedule and timezone overrides and opt-in/opt-out); default is
   ``maid_offhours``.
 - **opt-out**: Determines the behavior for resources which do not have a tag
   matching the one specified for **tag**. Values can be either ``false`` (the
   default) where the policy operates on an opt-in basis and resources must have
   the tag in order to be acted on by the policy, or ``true`` where the policy
   operates on an opt-out basis, and resources without the tag are acted on by
   the policy.
 - **onhour**: the default time to start/run resources, specified as 0-23
 - **offhour**: the default time to stop/suspend resources, specified as 0-23

This example policy overrides most of the defaults for an offhour policy:

.. code-block:: yaml

   policies:
     - name: offhours-stop
       resource: ec2
       filters:
         - type: offhour
           weekends: false
           default_tz: pt
           tag: downtime
           opt-out: true
           onhour: 8
           offhour: 20

Tag Based Configuration
=======================

Resources can use a special tag to override the default configuration on a
per-resource basis. Note that the name of the tag is configurable via the
``tag`` option in the policy; the examples below use the default tag name,
``maid_offhours``.

The value of the tag must be one of the following:

- **(empty)** or **on** - An empty tag value or a value of "on" implies night
  and weekend offhours using the default time zone configured in the policy
  (tz=est if unspecified) and the default onhour and offhour values configured
  in the policy.
- **off** - If offhours is configured to run in opt-out mode, this tag can be
  specified to disable offhours on a given instance. If offhours is configured
  to run in opt-in mode, this tag will have no effect (the resource will still
  be opted out).
- a semicolon-separated string composed of one or more of the following
  components, which override the defaults specified in the policy:

  * ``tz=<timezone>`` to evaluate with a resource-specific timezone, where
    ``<timezone>`` is either one of the supported timezone aliases defined in
    :py:attr:`c7n.filters.offhours.Time.TZ_ALIASES` (such as ``pt``) or the name
    of a geographic timezone identifier in
    [IANA's tzinfo database](https://www.iana.org/time-zones), such as
    ``Americas/Los_Angeles``. *(Note all timezone aliases are
    referenced to a locality to ensure taking into account local daylight
    savings time, if applicable.)*
  * ``off=(time spec)`` and/or ``on=(time spec)`` matching time specifications
    supported by :py:class:`c7n.filters.offhours.ScheduleParser` as described
    in the next section.

ScheduleParser Time Specifications
----------------------------------

Each time specification follows the format ``(days,hours)``. Multiple time
specifications can be combined in square-bracketed lists, i.e.
``[(days,hours),(days,hours),(days,hours)]``.

**Examples**::

    # up mon-fri from 7am-7pm; eastern time
    off=(M-F,19);on=(M-F,7)
    # up mon-fri from 6am-9pm; up sun from 10am-6pm; pacific time
    off=[(M-F,21),(U,18)];on=[(M-F,6),(U,10)];tz=pt

**Possible values**:

    +------------+----------------------+
    | field      | values               |
    +============+======================+
    | days       | M, T, W, H, F, S, U  |
    +------------+----------------------+
    | hours      | 0, 1, 2, ..., 22, 23 |
    +------------+----------------------+

    Days can be specified in a range (ex. M-F).

       actions:

Here's doing the same with auto scale groups

.. code-block:: yaml

    policies:
      - name: asg-offhours-stop
        resource: asg
        filters:
           - offhour
        actions:
           - suspend
      - name: asg-onhours-start
        resource: asg
        filters:
           - onhour
        actions:
           - resume

Additional policy examples and resource-type-specific information can be seen in
the :ref:`EC2 Offhours <ec2offhours>` and :ref:`ASG Offhours <asgoffhours>`
use cases.

Resume During Offhours
======================

These policies are evaluated hourly; during each run (once an hour),
cloud-custodian will act on **only** the resources tagged for that **exact**
hour. In other words, if a resource has an offhours policy of
stopping/suspending at 23:00 Eastern daily and starting/resuming at 06:00
Eastern daily, and you run cloud-custodian once an hour via Lambda, that
resource will only be stopped once a day sometime between 23:00 and 23:59, and
will only be started once a day sometime between 06:00 and 06:59. If the current
hour does not *exactly* match the hour specified in the policy, nothing will be
done at all.

As a result of this, if custodian stops an instance or suspends an ASG and you
need to start/resume it, you can safely do so manually and custodian won't touch
it again until the next day.

ElasticBeanstalk, EFS and Other Services with Tag Value Restrictions
====================================================================

A number of AWS services have restrictions on the characters that can be used
in tag values, such as `ElasticBeanstalk <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbean
stalk/latest/dg/using-features.tagging.html>`_ and `EFS <http://docs.aws.amazon.
com/efs/latest/ug/API_Tag.html>`_. In particular, these services do not allow
parenthesis, square brackets, commas, or semicolons, or empty tag values. This
proves to be problematic with the tag-based schedule configuration described
above. The best current workaround is to define a separate policy with a unique
``tag`` name for each unique schedule that you want to use, and then tag
resources with that tag name and a value of ``on``. Note that this can only be
used in opt-in mode, not opt-out.
